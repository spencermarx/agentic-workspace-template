#                      gets published: the artifact platform supplies the document wrapper itself.
#   report.html      — the same, wrapped as a standalone document for opening locally, plus a
#                      mermaid loader when the content has a mermaid block. The loader is local-only
#                      because the artifact platform renders mermaid natively and reaches no CDN.

# Keeping both shapes derived from one authored file is what lets a revision regenerate the page

  <content.html>  page content — the elements that live inside <body>, typically one
                  <div class="r-page"> wrapper. Not a whole HTML document.
  <output-dir>    where report.page.html and report.html are written. Created if missing.
  --title         overrides the title, which otherwise comes from the first <h1>.
