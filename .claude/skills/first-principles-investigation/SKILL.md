description: >-
  Evidence-first root-cause investigation. Generates competing hypotheses, tests each
  against the actual system, and keeps going until exactly one survives. Use whenever
  something is behaving in a way nobody can explain, a fix did not hold, or the obvious
  cause has already been ruled out. Do NOT use when the cause is known and only the fix is
  in question.

# First-Principles Investigation

Most "debugging" is reasoning by analogy: _this looks like that bug last week, so
it's probably the same cause._ That's fast and often right — until it's wrong,
and then it sends you fixing a symptom while the real defect sits untouched. This
skill is the discipline for the times that matters: you trust **only what you
have observed in _this_ system**, you rebuild your understanding from the ground
up, and you refuse to act on a cause until the evidence forces it.

The whole method rests on one idea from Feynman: _the first principle is that you
must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool._ Everything below
is machinery for not fooling yourself.

## The stance

These four commitments are what separate a real investigation from "debug
carefully." Hold them the whole way through.

1. **Ground truth is the running system and its source — not docs, not memory,
   not analogy, not what anyone asserted (including the user).** Docs drift; the
   code and the logs don't. The function you're _sure_ you understand is the one
   that bites you. When a claim matters, go read the actual source or reproduce
   the behavior yourself.
2. **Separate evidence from inference, always.** "The request returned 401" is
   evidence. "Auth is broken" is an inference drawn from it. Confusing the two is
   how a plausible story hardens into false certainty. Label them differently in
   your own notes and in your report.
3. **Every hypothesis carries the observation that would kill it.** A cause you
   can't imagine disproving is worthless — every test will seem to "confirm" it
   and you'll learn nothing. Before you go looking, state: _what would I have to
   see for this to be false?_ Then go try to see that.
4. **Don't stop at the first plausible cause. Trace to the true root, and prove
   the fix.** The first wrong value you find is usually an _infection_ partway
   down the chain, not the _defect_ that started it. And a fix you can't toggle
   on and off to make the failure appear and disappear is not a proven fix — it's
   a hope. If you didn't verify it, it isn't fixed.

## Two modes, one method

The same discipline serves two kinds of investigation, and the vocabulary below
leans toward the first — but they're the same method:

- **Diagnose a failure** — "why is this 500ing", "why did the deploy desync". The
  goal is a _defect_, proven by making the failure appear and disappear.
- **Understand a mechanism** — "how does `@example-co/env` actually pick a value",
  "how does the auth-hook resolve claims". There's no bug; the goal is the _true
  model_ of how something works, proven by tracing the real code and confirming
  each claim.

When you're in mechanism mode, read the failure-oriented words as their
mechanism-mode twins: _reproduce_ → **trace and confirm the behavior**, _root
cause_ → **the mechanism / model**, _fix & proof_ → **how each claim in the model
is proven**. Everything else — the ledger, hypotheses-with-falsifiers, evidence vs.
inference, breadth-before-depth, reading the source over the docs — applies
unchanged, and matters just as much: a "how does it work" answer paraphrased from
the docs is exactly the failure this method exists to prevent.

## The core loop

In [references/the-loop.md](references/the-loop.md), together with the rules
for when to fan out to subagents. Load it before the first hypothesis, not
after.

## Output format

In [references/output-format.md](references/output-format.md). Load it before
writing the conclusion, not before starting the investigation.

## Before you conclude — self-audit

Fast pass against the ways a first-principles investigation still fails. Any "yes"
sends you back into the loop. Full catalog with guards in
`references/anti-patterns.md`.

- **Analogy** — am I acting on "it's like that other bug" rather than evidence
  from _this_ system?
- **Confirmation bias** — did I only run tests that would confirm my favored
  cause, and skip the one that could falsify it?
- **Anchoring** — am I under-weighting evidence that contradicts my first guess?
- **Symptom, not root** — is my "cause" actually an infected value partway down
  the chain, with an earlier defect still upstream?
- **ASSUME as fact** — is any step resting on an unverified item I never promoted
  to KNOW?
- **Authority over evidence** — am I trusting an assertion (the user's, a
  senior's, the docs') that I could have checked but didn't?
- **Unproven fix** — can I actually toggle the failure on and off with my change,
  or am I hoping?

## Going deeper

- **`references/method.md`** — the canonical grounding: Zeller's scientific-
  debugging loop and TRAFFIC workflow, Agans' 9 indispensable debugging rules, and
  the full technique toolbox (the cause-category checklist, falsifiability and
  cheapest-discriminating-observation, Fermi/constraint checks, correlation vs.
  causation, Socratic questioning). Read when you want the depth behind a phase.
- **`references/anti-patterns.md`** — the failure-mode catalog with concrete
  guards. Read at phase 8, or any time the investigation feels stuck or too easy.
- **`agents/hypothesis-tester.md`** — the sub-agent prompt for swarm mode.
